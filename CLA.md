## Contributor License Agreement

All contributors to this project must have a signed Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”) on file with us. The CLA grants us the permissions we need to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project; you or your employer retain the copyright to your contribution. Before a PR can pass all required checks, our CLA action will prompt you to accept the agreement. Head over to https://cla.vmware.com/ to see your current agreement(s) on file or to sign a new one.

We generally only need you (or your employer) to sign our CLA once and once signed, you should be able to submit contributions to any VMware project.

Note: a signed CLA is required even for minor updates. If you see something trivial that needs to be fixed, but are unable or unwilling to sign a CLA, the maintainers will be happy to make the change on your behalf. If you can describe the change in a [bug report](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/community-edition/issues/new/choose), it would be greatly appreciated.
